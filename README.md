How Malicious Extensions Can Harm Users?

Malicious extensions may look useful or innocent, but behind the scenes they can do dangerous things like:
1. Stealing Sensitive Data
Access login details, saved passwords, cookies
Can read personal data you enter on websites
Example: A fake extension pretending to be a shopping helper might steal your credit card info

2. Tracking and Spying
Continuously monitor your browsing activity
Collect your:
Search history
Visited websites
Location
IP address
This data can be sold to third parties or used in targeted attacks

3. Ad Injection and Redirects
Add unwanted ads on pages you visit
Redirect you to fake or phishing websites
You may click a link thinking it's Google or Facebook, but it’s actually a fake page designed to steal your password

4. Installing Malware
Some extensions silently download and install malware
They can run scripts that:
Encrypt your files (ransomware)
Take over your browser
Use your system for botnet or crypto mining

5. Bypassing Security Settings
Extensions can disable pop-up blockers, redirect settings, or even alter browser configurations
Some may trick users by hiding their name or icon in the extension list

6. Fake Reviews and Social Engineering
Malicious extensions often come with fake 5-star reviews to appear trustworthy
Some even imitate real brands like YouTube or Google Translate
